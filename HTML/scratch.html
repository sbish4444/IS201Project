        <h2>Major Cities in Macedonia</h2>
        <h3>Skopje: The Modern Capital </h3>
        Skopje, the <a href="https://www.chasingthedonkey.com/weekend-in-skopje-itinerary-macedonia/">capital</a>
        and largest city of North Macedonia, is a dynamic metropolis where ancient and modern elements
        intertwine. The city is dominated by landmarks such as the Stone Bridge, which connects the historic Old
        Bazaar to the more contemporary Macedonia Square. Skopje's architectural style is eclectic, featuring
        neo-classical
        government buildings from the controversial <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28951171">"Skopje
            2014"</a>
        project alongside Ottoman mosques and Byzantine churches. The Millennium Cross on Mount Vodno, visible from
        almost any part of the city, offers panoramic views and
        highlights Skopje’s scenic surroundings.

        <h3>Ohrid: The Jewel of the Balkans</h3>
        Ohrid, often referred to as the "Pearl of the Balkans," is a UNESCO World Heritage Site famed for its
        historical
        and
        natural significance. Nestled along the shores of Lake Ohrid, one of Europe’s deepest and oldest lakes, the
        city
        boasts a rich collection of medieval churches, monasteries, and traditional architecture. Ohrid is
        especially
        famous
        for the Church of St. John at Kaneo, perched on a cliff overlooking the lake. Visitors are drawn to its
        serene
        beaches, vibrant summer festivals, and the legacy of Saints Cyril and Methodius, who created the Cyrillic
        script
        here.

            life,

            consulates,

            Street

            heart of the city, lined with cafes, shops, and neoclassical buildings. Nearby, the ancient ruins of
            Heraclea
            Lyncestis, a city founded by Philip II of Macedon, showcase impressive mosaics and an amphitheater,
            offering

        <h1>History of North Macedonia</h1>
        Below is a short description of many of the major time periods in MAcedonia's histroy. If you'd rather watch a short video about Macedonia's history instead of reading about it, here you go! <br><br>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W5pRjCMRbGI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br><br>
        <ul>
            <li><h4>Antiquity</h4>
        The region was part of the ancient Kingdom of Macedon, ruled by Philip II and his son, Alexander the Great,
        whose empire shaped the course of world history. After Alexander's death, the territory became a battleground
        for successor states before becoming part of the Roman and Byzantine empires.</li>
        <br>
        <li><h4>Ottoman Rule</h4>
        From the late 14th century until 1912, Macedonia was under Ottoman rule. During this time, it became a
        multicultural region with strong Ottoman influences in architecture, religion, and trade. Skopje’s Old Bazaar
        and mosques, like the Mustafa Pasha Mosque, reflect this legacy.</li>
        <br>
        <li><h4>The Ilinden Uprising</h4>
        The Ilinden Uprising of 1903, led by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), sought autonomy
        from the Ottoman Empire. Though suppressed, the movement became a cornerstone of Macedonian identity and is
        celebrated annually on Ilinden Day.</li>
        <br>
        <li><h4>Macedonia in Yugoslavia</h4>
        After the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), Macedonia was incorporated into Serbia and later became a republic within
        socialist Yugoslavia in 1945. The period was marked by significant economic growth and the formal recognition of
        Macedonian identity, language, and culture. However, political repression stifled dissent.</li>
        <br>
        <li><h4>Independence and Modern Era</h4>
        North Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. The early years were fraught with economic
        struggles and ethnic tensions, culminating in a brief conflict with ethnic Albanian insurgents in 2001. The
        Ohrid Framework Agreement resolved this crisis, granting greater rights to minority communities.</li>
        <br>
        <li><h4>Skopje 2014</h4>
        The Skopje 2014 project, launched in the early 2010s, aimed to reshape the capital’s image with neoclassical
        architecture, statues, and public squares. While it revitalized parts of the city, critics questioned its cost
        and controversial aesthetics.</li>
        </ul>

        <br><br>
